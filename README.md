# SeattleAirBnBProj

This project deals with taking some Seattle AirBnB data and doing some basic data visualizations to see if one can find a way to charge higher prices and earn more by focusing on particular aspects of his or her AirBnB host profile. The project is exploratory in nature, and will continually be updated with different metrics which one can focus on.

### Key Questions answered :

1.) Does achieving the SuperHost status enable you to charge more for your properties?  
2.) Is the question above influenced by the neighbourhood ? Or does it hold true for all cases?  
3.) WHat about review boosting services? Are they worth your time ? Do having higher ratings help you charge more ?  

#### Questions for the future :

4.) Which keywords will help attract more visitors to your listing?  
5.) What about frequescy of updates? Does it influence customer selection ?  
6.) Pictures : Do large pictures help in getting more customers ?

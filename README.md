# SeattleAirBnBProj

This project deals with taking some Seattle AirBnB data and doing some basic data visualizations to see if one can find a way to charge higher prices and earn more by focusing on particular aspects of his or her AirBnB host profile. The project is exploratory in nature, and will continually be updated with different metrics which one can focus on.

### Key Questions answered :  

1.) Does achieving the SuperHost status enable you to charge more for your properties?  
Result : A visualization does support the assertion that having a superhost status does enable you to charge more for your properties. However, there are a lot of factors assumed equal here : We are not accounting for price variability caused by Neighbourhoods, extra amenities provided or simply, better and larger properties. Further analysis paints a conflicting picture. Thus, the superhost status seems to be a relatively minor factor in pricing

2.) Is the question above influenced by the neighbourhood ? Or does it hold true for all cases?  
Result: We only look at one neighbourhood here, but that immediately points out a different scenario as compared to the assertion above. Therefore, one cannot conclude that this holds for all cases,a nd is heavily influenced by neighborhoods.  

3.) What about review boosting services? Are they worth your time ? Do having higher ratings help you charge more ?  
Result: Generally more positive reviews do seem to trend towards higher pricing, so review boosting services may be worth paying for, if extremely unethical and running afoul of the AirBnB terms and Conditions. It may be just better to solicit positive reviews from guests.


#### Questions for the future :  

4.) Which keywords will help attract more visitors to your listing?  
5.) What about frequescy of updates? Does it influence customer selection ?  
6.) Pictures : Do large pictures help in getting more customers ?
